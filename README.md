# Rudis Netsuite Data
## ðŸ“£ Overview

The [Fivetran Netsuite Streamlit app](https://fivetran-netsuite.streamlit.app/) leverages data from the Fivetran Netsuite connector and Fivetran Netsuite data model to produce analytics ready reports. You may find the analytics ready reports within the pages of this Streamlit app (these may be found on the left pane). These dashboards have been constructed using a combination of the [netsuite2__balance_sheet](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_netsuite/#!/model/model.netsuite2.netsuite2__balance_sheet) and [netsuite2__income_statement](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_netsuite/#!/model/model.netsuite2.netsuite2__income_statement) models from the Fivetran [Netsuite dbt package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_netsuite).
